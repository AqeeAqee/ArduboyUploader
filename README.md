# Arduboy Uploader
Fast and clean Arduboy program uploader (compiled hex files)

I was not happy with the current uploaders so I made my own, check the source and download it here:
https://github.com/eried/ArduboyUploader/releases/

Demo how to use it:

The nice thing is that it integrates nicely with my repository:
